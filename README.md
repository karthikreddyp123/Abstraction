This task demonstrates a simple example of Abstraction.
CarDetails.java has private data which has getter and setter methods to set and retrieve data.
Person.java has abstract method through which we will achieve abstraction.
Owner.java, LocalRepairPerson.java and Expert.java has the implementation for abstract method in Person.java.
Abstraction.java has main method where we will create objects for all above classes and demonstrate the concept of abstraction.
